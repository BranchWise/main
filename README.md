## 🌍 Project Overview

Planting trees is a long-term investment requiring thoughtful consideration of various factors. While many global tree-planting initiatives focus solely on the number of trees planted, their success rates often suffer due to limited planning for the specifics.

Edmonton, like many cities, faces challenges with urban forest management including:
- Aging trees in need of replacment
- Limited biodiversity in urban green spaces
- Rapid urban development

BranchWise leverages machine learning to help address these challenges, by using publically accessible information on the trees currently planted in the City of Edmonton to make predictions about the success of planned tree planting.
